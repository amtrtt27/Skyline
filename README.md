🌇 SKYLINE
An AI-Driven Platform for Sustainable, Transparent Post-Disaster Reconstruction
SKYLINE is an end-to-end software platform designed to transform post-disaster rubble into actionable rebuilding resources. By integrating AI-powered damage assessment, ontology-based material reuse, and transparent procurement workflows, SKYLINE accelerates recovery while embedding circular-economy principles into reconstruction.
🚧 Problem Statement
Large-scale disasters and conflicts generate massive amounts of damaged buildings and construction debris. While modern computer vision can estimate damage and debris volume, current reconstruction workflows remain fragmented:
Damage assessment is disconnected from rebuilding plans
Debris is treated as waste rather than a recoverable resource
Procurement and approvals are slow, opaque, and bureaucratically siloed
Communities face prolonged displacement and rising reconstruction costs
SKYLINE addresses this gap by converting damage data directly into decision-ready reconstruction actions

💡 Solution Overview
SKYLINE is a modular, cross-platform system that links damage assessment → planning → material reuse → procurement → approvals in one coherent workflow.
Core Capabilities
AI Damage Assessment
Computer vision models classify building damage severity
Automatically estimate debris volumes with confidence scores
Reconstruction Planning
Generates material quantities, cost estimates, timelines, and reuse potential
Integrates historical building data and geospatial context
Ontology-Based Resource Engine
Catalogs recoverable materials from debris
Matches material condition, type, and location to reconstruction needs
Turns rubble into a planning asset rather than waste
Transparent Procurement & Approvals
Multi-criteria contractor bidding with auditable scoring
Rule-based approval workflows with role-based access control
🧠 System Architecture
SKYLINE is built as a modular, service-oriented platform:
AI Damage Detection Module
CNN-based models for damage classification and debris estimation
Geospatial Layer
Mapping APIs for geocoding, spatial optimization, and building data retrieval
Ontology Engine
Semantic reasoning system for material matching and reuse optimization
Procurement Module
Transparent, data-driven bidding and contractor selection
Approval Workflow Engine
Licensing, audit logs, and compliance tracking
The MVP focuses on damage assessment, planning, and basic resource matching, with iterative expansion during pilot deployment

🌍 Impact
Short-Term
Reduce damage assessment time from days to hours
Cut reconstruction planning and procurement from weeks to days
Lower costs and accelerate reopening of critical infrastructure
Long-Term
Institutionalize circular-economy practices in reconstruction
Improve transparency, accountability, and community trust
Enable scalable, resilient recovery across disaster contexts
📊 Evaluation Metrics
SKYLINE is evaluated using:
Time reduction in assessment, planning, and approvals
Percentage of debris reused or recycled
Cost savings per reconstruction project
User adoption and satisfaction
Transparency indicators (audit completeness, traceability)
⚠️ Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
Variable data quality	Confidence scoring + human-in-the-loop
Limited connectivity	Offline-capable design
Resistance to workflow change	Alignment with existing government & NGO processes
SKYLINE augments expert judgment—it does not replace it.
🧩 Use Cases
Government reconstruction authorities
Humanitarian and development organizations
Post-conflict recovery agencies
Urban resilience and sustainability programs
